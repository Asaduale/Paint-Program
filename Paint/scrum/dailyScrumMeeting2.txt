	Yesterday :
	Today     : Pull the assignment from the repo, create branch, add name to member.txt.
	Obstacles : A little bit of git issues, nothing serious.

Oct 24, 2017
	Yesterday : Pull repo.
	Today     : Create rectangle class, attempt at implementing it in the Paint Panel, completed in Paint Model.
	Obstacles : Merge conflicts, rectangles clone themselves, instead of one clean rectangle, you can see it being dragged.

Oct 25, 2017
	Yesterday : Rectangle class, rectangle in paint panel and model.
	Today     : Completed rectangle class, completed square class.
	Obstacles : Square works like rectangle, not sure if a square class is needed since a rectangle is a square.

	Yesterday : Square works like rectangle, completed rectangle.
	Today     : Day off.
	Obstacles : N/A

Oct 30, 2017
	Yesterday : Day off.
	Today     : Attempt at solving square working like a rectangle, no progress made.
	Obstacles : Square class has the same code as rectangle class, not sure how to implement with x and y axis and remember point.
				drawRect(x, y, width, height) has 4 parameters, x, y, width, height. A square has the same width and height but
				it will only focus on either width (x-axis) or height (y-axis) if two of the parameters are the
				same.

Oct 31, 2017
	Yesterday : Attempt at solving square in paint panel.
	Today     : Square now makes square shapes but the pivot point flies all over the place. It drags left and up but not 
				right and down.
	Obstacles : Trying to complete this final bug to complete my part of the assignment.

Nov 1, 2017
	Yesterday : Attempt at solving square.
	Today     : Closer to the solution, the first pivot point click slightly moves.
	Obstacles : Still not completed square.

	Today     : Sick.
	Obstacles : N/A
	
Nov 3, 2017
	Yesterday : Sick.
	Today     : Completed Square, better OO design.
	Obstacles :

Nov 4, 2017
	Yesterday : Completed Square
	Today     : Attempt at using JTextArea in the bottom left corner of the frame to show the user what color they're currently at
				when they drag the JSliders
	Obstacles : Not sure how to implement it.

	Obstacles : None
	
Nov 8, 2017
	Yesterday : None
	Today     : Attempt at implementing Bug 2.1, created DrawingCommand Class and had all subclasses of Shape inherit. 
	Obstacles : Not sure how to continue.
	
Nov 9, 2017
	Yesterday : Attempt at implementing Bug 2.1, created DrawingCommand Class and had all subclasses of Shape inherit. 
	Today     : Completed Bug 2.1.
	Obstacles : What code went inside the execute command.
	
Nov 10, 2017
	Yesterday : Completed Bug 2.1.
	Today     : Group members tested out my Command Design Pattern. I needed help from Group Member Anton. 
				I created the interface and implemented the execute method. Accidentally put execute() inside of all 
				the classes instead of making a separate class, Anton ended up doing that. 
	Obstacles : Slight misunderstanding of Command Design Pattern.

Nov 11, 2017
	Yesterday : Command Design Pattern completed.
	Today     : Bug 2.2 completed, it was completed along with 2.1 since all the graphics contex such as changing drawing 
			    color, stroke width etc were being changed along with it inside the execute command.
	Obstacles :
